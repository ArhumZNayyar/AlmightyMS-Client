# AlmightyMS-Client
A client made for private server AlmightyMS of the popular video game MapleStory. This program is able to patch a users game, opening 
the .WZ files and patch files and determines how to update the files by only downloading the new changes. 
It also encrypts and decrypts the files to prevent tampering.


This program is unfortunately privatized due to the nature of the method of encryption used to protect the game data and to prevent
cheating, tampering, and content stealing.
However, some pictures will be shown to demonstrate the program.
